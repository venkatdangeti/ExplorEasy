# ExploreEasy

## ExplorEasy is an app where users can search for an activity/trip/night out using their selected city.

This application was created by David Brooks, Fernanda, Venkat D and Teannie Binns.
Our motivation for this project was to allow users to easily plan a day out based on location and weather.
This solved the problem of using multiple apps to plan a day or evening out.
We figured out how to integrate multiple APIâ€™s into a site and get them all working in sync from one user search.
